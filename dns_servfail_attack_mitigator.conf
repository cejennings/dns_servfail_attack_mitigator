#: Description : This script will take a snapshot of the last 
#                SERVFAIL errors logged by BIND named as defined by 
#                certain limits below.  The script will then evaluate 
#                all the different IP addresses making queries and
#                the domains that are being queried and, based on 
#                weighting rules below, will make a determination if
#                a domain should be blocked with iptables.  By 
#                default this script will alert only, but the script
#                can be enabled to automatically block domains found
#                to be under attack.
#                During non-attack periods, if configured to auto-
#                block, the script will check for expired rules,
#                based on the configured timeframe, and remove rules.

## - For mitigation to take place, report_only_flag MUST be set to 0
## - AND mitigate_attack MUST be set to 1.  If report_only_flag is 
## - anything but 0 and mitigate_attack anything but 1, active
## - mitigation WILL NOT occur.  If mitigation is active, reporting
## - via email will still occur.

let report_only_flag=1     # 1=Yes, 0=No
let mitigate_attack=0      # 1=Yes, 0=No

## - email configuration:

email_subject_report_only="`hostname` under DNS SERVFAIL attack - Report Only - No Mitigation actions taken"
email_subject_mitigated="`hostname` under DNS SERVFAIL attack - Mitigation has occured"
email_subject_rule_cleanup="`hostname` DNS SERVFAIL attack - iptables Rule Cleanup has occured"

## - - Separate email addresses with comma

email_destination="jdoe@example.com,john.doe@example.com"

## - Provide the log file location where ISC BIND logs SERVFAIL 
## - notifications. (BIND > v9.7.0a1) 
## - - You MUST provide both the current file and the most recent 
## - - rotated file. 
## - - Your named.conf configuration for this log file MUST have the 
## - - following settings in the "channel xxx {};" config for the 
## - - "category query-errors {};" config: 
## - - (Note specifically the number of versions must be greater or 
## - - equal to 2 with sufficient size to get the max_records below 
## - - and each entry needs to be logged with a timestamp.)
##
## - -     file "/path/to/file/filename.ext" versions 2 size 20m;
## - -     print-time yes;
##

named_debug_log_file=/chroot/named/logs/dns_limiting.log
named_debug_log_file0=/chroot/named/logs/dns_limiting.log.0

## - Define specifics about reading the above mentioned log files.
## - - Depending on server speed and number of logged entries, the
## - - max_records should be tuned such that reading and evaluation
## - - of the log files leaves approximately 2 minutes of idle time
## - - beforethe next cron job rotation begins.  If the server is not
## - - under attack, specify the max_time in seconds to read from the
## - - log files. 

let max_records=15000
let max_time=300

## - - Next define the location of key elements in the log file 
## - - (columns in log file are read as space delimited).
## - - - (Confirm that the date is in column 1 and the time is in 
## - - - column 2.)

let column_of_ip_addr=7
let column_of_fqdn=12
#let column_of_fqdn=14

## - Define the values that will trigger a response from the script.
## - - Queries per minute from any one IP considered "Heavy"
## - - If any IP gets this rate, it will be given the weight of "3"

let ip_qpm_heavy_rate=60

## - - Queries per minute from any one IP considered "Midweight"
## - - If any IP gets this rate, it will be given the weight of "2"

let ip_qpm_midweight_rate=40

## - - Queries per minute from any one IP considered "Light"
## - - If any IP gets this rate, it will be given the weight of "1"

let ip_qpm_light_rate=20

## - This multiplier flags a domain to be evaluated at "Light Weight"
## - - A domain will be flagged for evaluation if the number of hits
## - - is equal to or greater than this number multiplied by 
## - - ip_qpm_light_rate in a 60 second timeframe. (calculated out 
## - - if less than 60 seconds are captured)

let min_mal_ip_per_domain=5

## - This multiplier flags a domain to be blocked at "Heavy Weight"
## - - This value causes a domain to be triggered for blocking as a
## - - multiplier of the "Heavy Weight". (In other words, this value
## - - times 3 - or this number of Heavy Weighted IPs would cause a
## - - block)

let block_trigger_value=15

## - Define the iptables chain to append the rule to use for blocking
## - domains.

iptables_chain="INPUT"

## - Define how long before blocking rule is removed (in hours)

let block_removal=48
